## 🤖 Unique Paths DP Visualizer

This project is an **interactive web application** that solves the classic **"Unique Paths"** problem using the **Dynamic Programming (DP)** paradigm. It provides a visual and computational tool to determine the number of distinct paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an $M \times N$ grid, allowing only moves to the right or down.

### ✨ Features

  * **Interactive Grid:** Users can input custom dimensions ($M$ and $N$) to generate a grid.
  * **Dynamic Programming Solution:** Calculates and displays the total number of unique paths efficiently using the DP algorithm.
  * **Gemini AI Explanation:** Integrates the **Gemini API** to provide an instant, detailed explanation of the **Dynamic Programming concept** used to solve the Unique Paths problem directly within the application.
  * **Live Preview:** Deployed as a live website using **GitHub Pages**.

### 🌐 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This project is designed to be easily deployed as a live web application using GitHub Pages. The key file is named `index.html`, which is automatically recognized as the entry point for the site.

The original project was deployed using the following steps:

1.  Create a new repository named `Dynamic-Programming-Unique-Paths-Calculator`.
2.  Upload `index.html` (the file containing the full project code).
3.  Go to **Settings** \> **Pages**.
4.  Set the **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
5.  Select the **`main`** branch and the **`/ (root)`** folder, and click **Save**.

This process makes the project accessible via the public URL provided above.
